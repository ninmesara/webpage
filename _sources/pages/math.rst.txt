Geometry Animations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These geometry animations use the excellent `JSXGraph <http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/index.html>`_ library.
They were inspired by the ones at `Cut the Knot <http://www.cut-the-knot.org/>`_.
These animations use only Javascript (no Java), which makes them more compatible
with modern web browsers and often faster.
